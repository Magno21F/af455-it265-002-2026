#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Complete the assigned case study
- [x] Brainstorm ideas for my boardgame

# Progress

## **What I accomplished**:
  I was able to complete the assigned case study for determining what makes a game bad. I also came up with a few ideas for a potential board game I could create.
  
## **Challenges faced**:
  I still had some trouble brainstorming ideas for the game. But I was still able to come up with something I could expand on.
 
## **Solutions**:
  N/A
  
## Learnings
  N/A 

## Free Thinking
- I came up with a game that uses paper, index cards, 1 die, and any 4 small objects that act as player tokens. The main idea is players have to race to 10 points (subject to change) by stealing, bluffing, and potentially sabatoging.
- Players collect matching sets of cards to score points. [Other players can steal your cards, block you, etc.]
- There would be around 40 cards total (subject to change)
- 20 "resource" cards: 5 gold, 5 wood, 5 stone, 5 food, 5 magic
- 10 "action" cards: (havent decided what actions yet0
- 10 "wild" cards: (haven't settled on what type of wild acts)

- 3 matching resource cards = 2 points (subject to change)
- 4 = 4 points (subject to change)

## Next Steps
- Brainstorm a proper turn structure for my game and incorporate the bluff tactics. 
- Finalize any things to add to the physical prototype
- Create the physical prototype
