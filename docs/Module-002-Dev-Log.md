#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Brainstorm ideas for games to submit for the final assignment 
- [ ] Work on the Atari Case Study

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  I was able to finish working on the Atari Case Study for my chosen game - Seaquest
- **Challenges faced**:
 Thinking of games that would be able to work for the assigment in class in 2d and 3d.
- **Solutions**:
N/A

#### Learnings
- I learned how to conduct a case study for a game and know what to look for when researching a game. This helps me consider things for my own game that I'm going to make. 

#### Free Thinking
- I could look into more older games that could be incorporated into digital/physical games. Maybe I can find some reference that way.
- The game I create doesn't have to be so complicated.

#### Next Steps
- Focus on brainstorming ideas for a board/tabletop game that works multiplayer
